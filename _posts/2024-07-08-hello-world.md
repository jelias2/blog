## Hello World
First post figuring out this jekyll markdown blog

---

### This is a header

#### Some Go Code

```go
import (
    "fmt"
)

func main(){
    fmt.Println("hello world!")
}
```

#### Bash

```bash
# There are many other languages you can use, but the style has to be loaded first
> go run helloworld.go
```
